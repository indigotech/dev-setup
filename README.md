Next steps
----------

  1. Oh My ZSH install script runs `env zsh` in the end. It needs to find a way to skip that or finish the zsh proccess.
  2. The script still stops in some points asking for information. Idealliy it should run unattended.
  3. App Store apps need to be installed manually. Neither Homebrew Cask or Battleschool supports that.
  4. Check if everything was installed successfully in the end and show the errors if any.
